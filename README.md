# nanoTTS
Simple project which reads chat from a discord channel and sends it to TTS Voice Wizard. Currently will be very manual, but may work on a more autonomus version of this project.

## How it works:
Find your discord authorization token, the channel id in which you want to read the messages, insert the discord username you want to read from, and set the filepath (the txt file). Insert these variables into the script. Then in TTSVoiceWizard have this enabled

You may need to spam the read from text file option to make it work. Once it is all set up, you can type in the specific channel and it will be read from the .txt file into the program!
